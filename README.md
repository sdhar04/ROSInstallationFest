**Ever dreamed of building robots that can:**

* Navigate mazes like a pro? 
* Integrate data from all their sensors to visualise the environment around them and convert it into an understandable format for you? 
*  Whip up a mean cup of coffee (okay, maybe not yet, but the future is bright!) ☕️

**Then buckle up, because ROS is your key to making it happen!**

**What is ROS?**

Imagine a giant toolbox filled with everything you need to build a robot.  **ROS** is like that toolbox, but even cooler!  It's a free and open-source framework that lets you:

* **Control your robot's hardware:**  Tell those motors to whirr and those sensors to see!
* **Write code easily:**  Focus on the cool robot stuff, not reinventing the wheel (or the motor driver).
* **Reuse code from others:**  No need to start from scratch when someone else has already built something awesome. 
* **Work with different robots:**  ROS is like a universal language for robots,  so you can switch things up without a headache.

A typical desktop using ROS looks like this:

And with the right usage and more advanced bots, it can look like this!

**Why participate in the ROS Installation Fest?**

The Robotics Club is your gateway to the exciting world of ROS!  We'll help you:

* **Install ROS on your system:** We'll guide you through the daunting process of setting up a dual boot system and installing ROS on it!
* **Learn ROS from the ground up:** No experience necessary, just a curious mind and the drive to test things out on your own!
* **Build awesome robots with your fellow robot enthusiasts:** We have established a great community to help you through it all, and you will be learning with your friends!
* **Get access to cool resources:** We have the tools you need to bring your robot dreams to life!
* **Participate in competitions and showcase your skills:** This fest will be your induction to the Robotics Summer Camp, where you will be given exciting tasks and evaluated on the same, eventually opening a path for you to join the Robotics Club!
